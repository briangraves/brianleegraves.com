			A UI designer, developer and strategist who's passionate about design and the process behind it, I'm a strong proponent of iterative work, collaborative efforts, and user first design. I'm currently an Engineering Manager at DEG where I lead multiple teams doing cross-channel design and development work for a range of major clients and brands. In addition to my 9-5, I have several side projects including Responsive Email Patterns and Responsive Email Resources and speak and write regularly.

			When not immersed in design, I can be found around Kansas City trying out new dinner and drink spots, following Kansas basketball, or at home discovering new music, working on my cooking skills, and hanging out with my wife and two miniature Australian Shepherds.

			I'm always interested in hearing from you about speaking opportunities or just to discuss a project idea. Feel free to get in touch below.
